# Overview
`kube-opex-analytics` (literally *Kubernetes Opex Analytics*) is a Kubernetes usage analytics tool to help organizations track the resources being consumed by their Kubernetes clusters over time (hourly, daily, monthly). Doing so `kube-opex-analytics` aims to prevent overpaying by enabling each organization to understand how their Kubernetes resources are consumed over time, and hence be able to take appropriated cost optimization decisions.

 * **Usage accounting and trends per namespace.** This allows assessing what capacities each namespace is consuming over various period of time (hourly, daily, monthly).
 * **Accounting of non-allocatable capacities.** At node and cluster levels, `kube-opex-analytics` tracks and consolidates the share of non-allocatable capacities and highlights them against usable capacities (i.e. capacities used by actual application workloads). In contrary to usable capacities, non-allocatable capacities are dedicated to Kubernetes operations (OS, kubelets, etc).
 * **Cluster usage accounting and capacity planning.** This feature makes it easy to account and visualize capacities consumed on a cluster, globally, instantly and over time.
 * **Usage/requests efficiency.** Based on hourly-consolidated trends, this functionality helps know how efficient resource requests set on Kubernetes workloads are, compared against the actual resource usage over time.
 * **Cost allocation and charge back analytics:** automatic processing and visualization of resource usage accounting per namespace on daily and monthly periods.
 * **Insightful and extensible visualization.** `kube-opex-analytics` enables built-in analytics dashboards, as well as a native Prometheus exporter that exposes its analytics metrics for third-party visualization tools like Grafana.

# Getting Started
  * [Installation on Kubernetes](./docs/installation-on-kubernetes.md)
  * [Installation on Docker](./docs/installation-on-docker.md)
  * [Built-in dashboards and charts](./docs/built-in-dashboards-and-charts.md)
  * [Prometheus Exporter and Grafana Dashboards](./docs/prometheus-exporter-grafana-dashboard.md)

# Design Fundamentals
Checkout the [Design Fundamentals](./docs/design-fundamentals.md) documentation to learn more about `kube-opex-analytics`, it introduces concepts and implementation decisions.
 
> **Multi-cluster analytics:** `kube-opex-analytics` tracks the usage for a single instance of Kubernetes. For a centralized multi-Kubernetes usage analytics, you may have to consider our [Krossboard](https://krossboard.app/) product. Watch a [demo video](https://youtu.be/lfkUIREDYDY).

# Configuration Variables
This section provides an exhaustive list of configuration variables used by `kube-opex-analytics`. 

> These are **startup environment variables** that require to restart the service when they are updated. 

* `KOA_DB_LOCATION` sets the path to use to store internal data. Typically when you consider to set a volume to store those data, you should also take care to set this path to belong to the mounting point.
* `KOA_K8S_API_ENDPOINT` sets the endpoint to the Kubernetes API.
* `KOA_K8S_CACERT` sets the path to CA file for a self-signed certificate.
* `KOA_K8S_AUTH_TOKEN` sets a Bearer token to authenticate against the Kubernetes API.
* `KOA_K8S_AUTH_CLIENT_CERT` sets the path to the X509 client certificate to authenticate against the Kubernetes API.
* `KOA_K8S_AUTH_CLIENT_CERT_KEY` sets the path to the X509 client certificate key.
* `KOA_K8S_AUTH_USERNAME` sets the username to authenticate against the Kubernetes API using Basic Authentication.
* `KOA_K8S_AUTH_PASSWORD` sets the password for Basic Authentication.
* `KOA_COST_MODEL` (version >= `0.2.0`): sets the model of cost allocation to use. Possible values are: _CUMULATIVE_RATIO_ (default) indicates to compute cost as cumulative resource usage for each period of time (daily, monthly); _CHARGE_BACK_ calculates cost based on a given cluster hourly rate (see `KOA_BILLING_HOURLY_RATE`); _RATIO_ indicates to compute cost as a normalized percentage of resource usage during each period of time.
* `KOA_BILLING_HOURLY_RATE` (required if cost model is _CHARGE_BACK_): defines a positive floating number corresponding to an estimated hourly rate for the Kubernetes cluster. For example if your cluster cost is $5,000 dollars a month (i.e. `~30*24` hours), its estimated hourly cost would be `6.95 = 5000/(30*24)`.
* `KOA_BILLING_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` (optional, default is '`$`'): sets a currency string to use to annotate costs on reports.
